# Character-stripper-tool-Python
A little tool made to scan text files in the current directory and strip them of unwanted characters. It was made for lab members to use on the output files of WGCNA, which gives gene names in lists as "17782" which makes the user then manually remove them from every file before using in Gene ontology databases.
